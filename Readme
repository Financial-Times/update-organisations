A small app to solve concordances for long-lasting queries.

##The idea behind:
Let's suppose we have uuid1 and uuid2 concorded.
UUID1 - was picked as canonical - but it is not yet in our system.
UUID2 - is already in our system, having a lot of relationships. The transfer would be too costly.
Instead:
renamed UUID2 node to UUID1, and add an Identifier for "UUID1".

##Notice:
- This only works, if only one of the nodes exists in db. (The code checks and ensures this.)
- In case if there are more then 2 nodes, which need concordance, the app ensures that only one of them exists in the DB.
